Flask-PyMongo
=============

Disclaimer
----------

I wrote and abandoned this back in 2011. It was never used in production. I'm
throwing it up in the public partially so I don't lose it and partially in case
anybody wishes to provide constructive criticism.

Unfortunately, between the time I wrote this and now, someone else wrote an
official extension with the same name. I'm leaving the name as-is for now. If
someone encounters this repository and is bothered by the name, please just
contact me and we can sort it out.


Description
-----------

Flask-PyMongo aims to provide a minimal wrapper around pymongo to support
schemaless models for Flask applications. The intention is to provide a means
of integration with standard Flask configuration and encourage code
organization through models without deviating away from the already
clean and flexible pymongo API.
